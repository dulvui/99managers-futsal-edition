- In the formation screen, visible players' positions their 'squares'.
- Make the players' attributes visible in the formation screen, by clicking on their squares or perhaps by hovering over them.
- For the selection of the starting lineup, first select players in the 'Players' section,
  then you drag the selected players to their positions in the formation screen,
