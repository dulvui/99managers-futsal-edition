## Backlog
Features/issues that will [probably] be added/solved in future.

- In-game editor for player and team
- Visible players' attributes during match
- In the formation screen, visible players' positions their 'squares'.
- Make the players' attributes visible in the formation screen, by clicking on their squares or perhaps by hovering over them.
- Add a futsal court design when selecting your starting lineup showing where each position is located.
- For the selection of the starting lineup, first select players in the 'Players' section,
  then you drag the selected players to their positions in the formation screen,
  instead of having the entire squad there.
- When you drag a player into a position, highlight the player's favorite position in the court design.
- Add teams' colors, the top of the screen should be blue and red
- Visualize your squad starting from the base to the tip (Goalkeepers on the top, then D -> C -> W, etc)
