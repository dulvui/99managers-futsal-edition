# Roadmap
List of features/issues for future versions of 99 Managersâ„¢ Futsal Edition.  
So users from [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/dulvui/futsal-manager) and [Github](https://codeberg.org/dulvui/futsal-manager) can track issues/features with ease.

Note: Not all features/bugs are related to a Codeberg/Github issue, since I get feedback also trough other channels.
