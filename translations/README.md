If you want to add a new language or want to improve an existing one, your are very welcome!
In case of issues, you can always contact me under [info@simondalvai.org](mailto:info@simondalvai.org).

## Sync with game
These files are not the ones used in the final game.  
A script makes a copy of this files to `game/translations`, to prevent merge conflict issues.
The script can be found in `scripts/translations`, but is not complete yet.

## Contributors
Thanks a lot to all contributors that added new languages and improved the languages in the game!  
As soon as I understand how to get a scripted contributors list from Weblate (propbabpy trough the API),
I will create a script that adds all contributors here and to the game.


## License
The translations have the same license as the source code: [AGPLv3](LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt)
