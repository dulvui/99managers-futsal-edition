If you want to add a new language or want to improve an existing one, your are very welcome!
In case of issues, you can always contact me under [info@simondalvai.org](mailto:info@simondalvai.org).

## Translation files
The translation files for the game in gettext format can be found in `game/translations`.
Other non in-game translations, like the store page descriptions used in Steam, can be found here in `store-pages`.

Anyway translations trough Weblate should be preferred over direct translations, to prevent double translations and merge conflicts.
If still prefer editing the files directly feel free to do so, but be aware of the issues stated above.

## CSV to gettext migration
This project started with simple CSV files for translations, but Godot supports also [gettext](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/localization_using_gettext.html).
That is a more complex but also more advanced format, that supports pluralization and is more git friendly.
In addition it works much better with Weblate than simple CSV files.

## Contributors
Thanks a lot to all contributors that added new languages and improved the languages in the game!  
As soon as I understand how to get a scripted contributors list from Weblate (probably trough the API),
I will create a script that adds all contributors here and to the game.

## License
The translations have the same license as the source code: [AGPLv3](LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt)
